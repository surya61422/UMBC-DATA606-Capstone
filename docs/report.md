## Background
### What is it about?
This project aims to predict whether customers will subscribe to personal loan offers provided by a bank based on various demographic and banking-related attributes.

### Why does it matter?
Understanding the factors influencing customers' decisions to subscribe to personal loan offers can help banks optimize their marketing strategies and increase their loan business while retaining existing customers.

### Research Questions
1. What demographic and banking-related factors influence customers' decisions to subscribe to personal loan offers?
2. Can we accurately predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan offer?
3. Which features have the most significant impact on predicting customer subscription to personal loan offers?

## Data
